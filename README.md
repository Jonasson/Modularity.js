# Modularity.js 0.1
One challenge when developing JavaScript heavy web sites/applications is to organize them in a good way.
Modularity.js approaches this problem with the help of a couple of great JavaScript projects and then add some own ideas
on top of that.

## Dependencies

### RequireJS
RequireJS allows you to divide your project into smaller parts in a clever way.

### Backbone.js
Backbone.js is a great project. Modularity.js add a more modular thinking to the mix.

###jQuery and Underscore.js
Those two libraries offers a good "infra structure" to base the code on.

## Road map
Modularity.js is still in its infancy. It kind of works, but is probably not very stable. The idea is still developing
rapidly. Hopefully its already interesting interesting enough to draw some attention and luring other developers to
contribute.
