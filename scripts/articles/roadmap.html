  <h1>Roadmap</h1>
  <p>Modularity.js is still in its infancy. It's changing rapidly, and are not very stable. Yet. If you find this project
  promising, please join!</p>

  <h2>Pipeline</h2>

  <h3>Cross-browser compatibility</h3>
  <p>
    So far Modularity.js (and this site) has only been tested with Firefox 3 and 4. Which browsers should be
    supported?
  </p>

  <h3>Attribute values</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You should not have to enter an empty value ({}).</li>
    <li>
      JSON is used today, but maybe a more terse one could be used. <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>
      could be a source of inspiration in how it handles attribute values.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module IDs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You should not have to give every module element an ID. The module key should be generated with a counter.</li>
  </ul>
