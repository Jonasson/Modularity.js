  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    A big challenge when you develop JavaScript heavy web sites/applications is to organize them in a
    good way. Modularity.js approaches this problem with the help of a couple of great JavaScript projects and then adds
    some own ideas on top of that.
  </p>

  <p>There are two core ideas Modularity is built upon worth mentioning: modularity and declarative programming.

  <h2>Modularity</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity">Modularity</a> is such an important idea to this project, it gave
    it its name. The hope is that modularity will let you organize your code in a way that both let you reuse more code,
    and to avoid that wall we all have run into. The wall that hits you in your face when your project have been a
    headache to continue with, beacause you can't figure out which parts relates to eachother. That's when all the fun
    ends. Have you been there? Then you understand the importance of a good project structure.
  </p>

  <h2>Declarative Programming</h2>
  <p>
    The definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative programming</a> is maybe
    a bit vague. In the case of Modularity.js it essentially means that you tell when a module should be used, and
    maybe set some options, via <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/">custom data attributes</a>
    directly in the markup. When you create a module, you define which attribute that should be associated with it. In
    the example below there are modules associated with the "data-controller", "data-article" and "data-menu" attributes.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="html">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Modularity.js Example&lt;/title&gt;
    .
    .
    .
    &lt;script data-main="scripts/bootstrap.js" src="scripts/require.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;!-- The routes below is handled by a Backbone.js controller --&gt;
  &lt;body id="controller" data-controller='{
    ""            : [ "welcome:article" ],
    "about"       : [ "about:article" ],
    "inspiration" : [ "inspiration:article" ]
  }'&gt;
    &lt;div id="page"&gt;
      &lt;!-- this module turns the menu into a dropdown menu.
           It's unaffected by the controller. --&gt;
      &lt;nav data-menu='{ "effect": "slide" }'&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#inspiration"&gt;Inpsiration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/nav&gt;

      &lt;!--
        These divs are bound to an article module. The controller decides if
        they should be visible or not.
        The module checks the div id to decide which content to load.
      --&gt;
      &lt;div id="welcome" data-article='{}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="about" data-article='{}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div id="inspiration" data-article='{}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

  <h2>About this documentation</h2>
  <p>
    This site is built with Modularity.js, and is in itself an example of how Modularity.js works. Please,
    <a href="https://github.com/Jonasson/Modularity.js/tree/gh-pages">take a look at the source</a> if you are curious
    and want an example of how it works.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as the project itself, this documentation is in a rough state. Expect a lot of Swenglish and quirky behavior...
  </p>

  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
    The goal has been to minimize the dependencies to a minimum.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a></h3>
  <p>
    RequireJS allows you to divide your project into smaller parts in a clever way. You could use Modularity.js
    without RequireJS if you want to, but it is not meant to be used that way.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></h3>
  <p>Great DOM manipulation. There is a hard dependency on this framework and Modularity.js will not work without it.</p>

  <h2>Other inspiration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=zakas-architecture">Zakas modular architecture</a>
      <p>
        This video is probably what got it started, even though Modularity.js is quite different from the code Zaka
        shows here. The sandbox was a part of Modularity.js in its earliest incarnations, but was eventually dropped.
        You could probably offer similar functionality via RequireJS.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>
      <p>
        The way Knockout handles attribute values is beautiful. Modularity.js uses JSON strings which is not optimized
        to be embedded in HTML attributes, but you must start with something...
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cross-Browser Compatibility</h2>
  <p>
    Modularity.js is not properly Cross-Browser tested yet. So far tested on:
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox 3.6+</li>
      <li>Chrome 11</li>
    </ul>
